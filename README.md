## Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project is a modern, interactive version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It emphasizes clean structure, efficient DOM manipulation, and an enhanced user experience through dynamic coloring and input validation.

# Features
 - Dynamic Grid Generation
 - Generates a default 16×16 grid, with support for custom sizes up to 100×100.

 - Hover-Based Drawing with Color Darkening
 - Grid squares are colored with a random RGB value on first hover, and darken by 10% on each subsequent      hover—creating a layered, sketch-like effect.

 - Customizable Grid Size
   Users can input their desired grid size via prompt. Robust validation ensures only integer values between 1 and 100 are accepted.

 - Reset Functionality
   Easily reset the canvas by generating a new grid at any time.
