## Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project is a web-based version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases DOM manipulation and user interaction with mouse events. 
Users can customize the grid size, draw by hovering over the grid squares, and reset the grid to the default state.

# Features
 - Dynamic Grid Creation: The default grid is 16x16, but users can customize it up to 100x100.
 - Hover-based Drawing: The grid squares change color when the user hovers over them, simulating the drawing experience.
 - Customization: The user can specify a custom grid size via a prompt.
 - Reset Functionality: The grid can be reset back to the default size (16x16) at any time.
