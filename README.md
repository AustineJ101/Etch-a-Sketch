## Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project is a web-based version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases DOM manipulationand an enhanced user experience through dynamic coloring and input validation.

# Features
 - Dynamic Grid Generation: 
   The default grid is 16x16, but users can customize it up to 100x100.

 - Hover-Based Drawing with Color Darkening:
   The grid squares change color when the user hovers over them, simulating the drawing experience. Once a square has been colored, each additional hover darkens it by 10%, giving a layered sketch-like feel.

 - Customization:
   Users can specify a custom grid size via a prompt. Input validation ensures only numeric values between 1 and 100 are accepted.
